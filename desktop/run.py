"""astrowidget desktop — cross-platform launcher (Windows / macOS / Linux).

This is the launcher to use on Windows (and the easiest cross-platform path
anywhere): `pip install PySide6` bundles its own Qt 6, so no separate Qt install
is needed. It loads the exact same QML UI as the Linux run.sh launcher.

    pip install PySide6
    python3 run.py

The Python fetcher must be running on a schedule (Task Scheduler on Windows,
systemd timer on Linux) so that state.json exists for the window to read.
