"""
End-to-end integration test against the REAL compiled Dart scoring binary.

This is the committed, repeatable version of the spec-to-screen trace. It runs
the full fetcher pipeline (real merge + real subprocess to astrowidget-score +
real enrichment) with only the two network fetches mocked, and asserts that:
  - 7Timer seeing/transparency reach state.json displayFactors with the correct
    (1-8, 1=best) labels — the CRIT-1 guard;
  - the narrowband score is tagged the heuristic method (Fix #5 guard);
  - the +2-night dark window is covered by the 4-day forecast (Fix #4 guard).

Skips cleanly (not fails) when the binary hasn't been built, so the unit suite
stays green on a fresh checkout. Build it with:
  cd scoring && dart pub get && dart build cli -t bin/score_location.dart -o /tmp/b \
    && cp /tmp/b/bundle/bin/score_location ../bin/astrowidget-score
