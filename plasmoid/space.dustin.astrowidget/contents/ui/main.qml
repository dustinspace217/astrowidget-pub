// Plasma 6 root is a PlasmoidItem (Plasma 5's `Item` no longer works as the
// root). Plasmoid.compactRepresentation and Plasmoid.fullRepresentation
// are Component-typed attached properties set here so the Plasma shell can
// instantiate the right view based on placement (panel = compact,
// desktop = full).
//
// StateModel is declared as a sibling QtObject so both representations can
// bind to the same instance. Both Components below reference `model` by id.
//
// The `pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound` ensures inline Components can see
// outer IDs like `model` — without it, Qt 6 raises an unqualified-access
// warning and the binding fails to resolve at runtime.
//
// Design spec §6.3.
