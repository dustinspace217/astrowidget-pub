.SYNOPSIS
	Registers (or updates) the astrowidget fetch scheduled task on Windows — the
	Task Scheduler equivalent of the Linux systemd user timer + service.

.DESCRIPTION
	Creates a per-user task "astrowidget-fetch" that runs the Python fetcher 4x
	per day. Re-running overwrites the existing task (idempotent), the same way
	`systemctl --user enable` is on Linux.

	TWO things here are load-bearing and were chosen deliberately:

	1. LogonType = Interactive ("run only when user is logged on"). The fetcher
	   emits WinRT toast notifications; a toast is only DISPLAYED when the task
	   runs inside the logged-in user's interactive session. A task set to "run
	   whether logged on or not" executes in Session 0, where the toast is
	   created but never shown (Session 0 isolation). Interactive also means no
	   stored password is needed — it uses the user's existing session token.

	2. pythonw.exe (windowless) is preferred over python.exe so the 4x/day run
	   doesn't flash a console window. The fetcher guards against pythonw's
	   None stdout/stderr; its important errors still surface as toasts and as
	   stale data in the widget. To see detailed output, run the fetcher
	   manually: `python <repo>\fetcher\astrowidget_fetch.py`.

	Unlike the Linux timer (UTC-aligned to the 6-hourly GFS model cycle), the
	triggers here are four FIXED LOCAL times (00:10, 06:10, 12:10, 18:10). The
	forecast still updates 4x/day; depending on your timezone it may read a model
	run a couple hours old, which is negligible for a multi-night forecast — and
	it avoids fragile UTC/DST DateTime math in PowerShell.

.PARAMETER FetcherPath
	Path to astrowidget_fetch.py. Defaults to ..\fetcher\ relative to this script.

.PARAMETER PythonExe
	Python executable to run the fetcher. Defaults to auto-detect (pythonw.exe,
	then python.exe) on PATH.

.PARAMETER TaskName
	Scheduled task name. Defaults to "astrowidget-fetch".

	powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\windows\register-fetch-task.ps1
