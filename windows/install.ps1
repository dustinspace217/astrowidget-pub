.SYNOPSIS
	astrowidget Windows installer — the install.sh equivalent for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
	Builds the Dart scoring binary from the in-repo scoring/ package, creates
	config.toml from the template, registers the 4x/day fetch scheduled task, and
	(optionally) runs the fetcher once. Idempotent: safe to re-run after changes;
	it never clobbers an existing config.toml.

	There is NO plasmoid on Windows — the KDE Plasma widget is Linux-only. On
	Windows the forecast is shown by the cross-platform desktop app
	(desktop\run.py via PySide6); see desktop\README.md and WINDOWS.md.

	Run from anywhere (the script resolves repo paths relative to itself):
	  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\windows\install.ps1

.PARAMETER NoFetch
	Skip the initial fetcher run (e.g. when the config still has placeholders).
