// Data models for weather forecast and air quality data from Open-Meteo.
//
// These are plain Dart classes with no framework dependencies — usable by
// the HTTP client, cache, scoring engine, or tests without importing
// Flutter, Riverpod, or Drift.
//
// Phase E Task 6: [WeatherForecast] gained a [derivedSeeing] field — a
// nullable [SeeingResult] computed once per (location, fetch) cycle.
// Plan 5 §10.2 mandates this caching shape: one derived-seeing HTTP call
// per weather refresh, never per-target. Scoring reads forecast.derivedSeeing
// instead of invoking DerivedSeeingService itself. Null means "cache predates
// Phase E" or "SeeingResult serialized with an unknown discriminator";
// both are treated as "no seeing available" by consumers.
